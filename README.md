A Web Based MUD Using Socket.io

`node index.js` or `node .`

The client files are in `static/`, but do not browse `static/` directly; browse to `http://host_ip:5500` instead while running the server as above.

This project uses:

- React, a JavaScript framework for web applications.
- react-bootstrap, a CSS framework for creating grid layouts.
- socket.io, a two-way communication framework (https://socket.io/)
- Node and Express for the server.
- JSON, a data format, to store and transfer data.
- Gulp, to automate development workflow (https://gulpjs.com/)
